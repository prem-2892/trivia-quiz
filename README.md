## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full stack developer...

I am always making some projects like this just sharpen my skills
every now and then. I am mainly interested in React so most of my
projects will be done with React. (Apologies if you prefer otherwise)

This project also includes REDUX as an external state manager. If
you enable redux dev tool it will show every state.
